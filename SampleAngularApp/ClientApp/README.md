### Easy

Accepts user input to save pokémon data and displays data in a table.

### Easy/Intermediate

Set and get from local storage to make the data persist even when closing/refreshing browser.

### Further development ideas:

- Add more input fields
- Style the page with css
- Add function to delete entries/clear table
- Break out the table to it's own component
- Use [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to get Pokémon data and display it
